## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS named Grid lines
- CSS positioning

### Continued development

I really have to review how to properly size and deal with images and svgs in a responsive manner. I just copy and pasted the starts to have them as a set of five, but as the page shrinks, media queries are necessary in order to avoid seeing them become distorted. I also had to fix the size of the profile pictures using a grid, but I'm not quite sure this was the best solution. Any advice on how you solved this?
